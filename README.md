## Simple Paytm Clone
Build a basic version of PayTM
Using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), I've built a fully functional web application designed to mimic the functionality of Paytm, albeit with a twist. Instead of integrating with real banks, I've implemented a system using randomly generated money for user accounts.

Here's a brief overview of the project:

🔐 Authentication: Implemented endpoints for user signup and signin functionalities to ensure secure access to the platform.

🖥️ Dashboard: Created a dynamic dashboard where users can view their account balances and a list of all users registered on the platform.

💸 Send Money: Developed a feature-rich page where users can send fake money to any other user on the platform, simulating real transactions.
